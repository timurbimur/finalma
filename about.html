    <h2>Diva Brought to Life:</h2>
    <p>Diva Espresso was brought to life in January of 1992. Although Diva had her growing pains, owner Greg Hamper and his daughter Jessica Moses nurtured her excellence through care of the roasting process, the employees, and new locations. Diva has both neighborhood and downtown locations, bringing the Diva owned entities to
seven.</p>

    <h2>Highland Blends:</h2>
    <p>In 2001, Diva's owners came to the realization that noteworthy coffee only originates with fair and equitable relationships between grower, broker, roaster and consumer. It was as continues to be Diva's belief that the inestimable effect human dignity has on anything produced and the success of that product. By being involved in the process from inception to resolution, it is Diva's belief that not only the product be superb, but that all is right in the world...every step of the way.
This led to the founding of Highlands Coffee Company, exclusive custom roaster and management company for Diva Espresso. Highlands Coffee Company operates out of North Seattle and offers high end Small Batch product infused with care, knowledge, art and vision of all who
had a hand in bringing it to you. By roasting in small batches, the coffee is fresher with desired aroma and depth of flavor that adds another layer of quality and freshness to the coffee equation.</p>
